## Why this article is interesting

This article reports that Google and Apple have failed to overturn rulings made against them by the EU, Apple for evading taxes in Ireland and Google for directing its search engine users to its own shopping service over other search results.

I found this interesting because the decline of Google as a useful search engine has been a well-known and frustrating phenomenon for some years now. While the factors involved go well beyond Google Shopping, I'm hopeful that it could be a start towards reversing the trend by discouraging practices that contribute to it.
